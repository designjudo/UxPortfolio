Thanks for drooping by! I'm a Navy veteran, ex-bartender and nocturnal designer/developer living in Jacksonville, Florida. I spent most of my time hanging with my four-year-old, and trying to find the perfect Old-Fashioned. I lived in Japan for a few years, and am crazy about authentic Ramen. Enough about me, let's talk about code!

This past year I have been involved in some huge projects, and figured this would be a great way to channel some ideas and thoughts about the design & development industry as a whole.

I'm a lead UX Designer for an enterprise healthcare corporation working on several projects within my organization, I've been designing customer experience (CX) applications that call center advocates use to serve their members. I've been building protoypes, sitting with users, coding UiKits, writing documentation, architecting design patterns, drinking lots of coffee and going to lots of meetings about data.

#### **Disclaimer!**
I am very opinionated about the technology and tools we've been using lately, but would love to hear about what everyone has found useful in their experience.

### Current Toolbelt:

* **Design** — Primarily Adobe XD for speed, but also Sketch and inVision Studio
* **Illustration/ Animation** — Adobe CC, Cinema4D
* **Prototyping** — inVision + Maze
* **IDE** — VsCode / WebStorm
* **Framework** — React/ Redux, Next.js, Gatsby
* **CSS** — Material-UI, Styled-Components & JSS
* **Global theme objects > Global Stylesheets** 
* **CSS-in-JSS > Sass**
